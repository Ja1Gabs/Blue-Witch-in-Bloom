# Blue-Witch-in-Bloom
Blue Witch in Bloom is a personal project, a game made in the Godot engine in its own language based on Python. I took the initiative of this project with the goal of learning more about the logic of programming in Python and entering this world of game creation. Only the programming and music are protected by copyright.
